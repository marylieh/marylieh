â™¥ My favorite game is [Life is Strange](https://lifeisstrange.square-enix-games.com/de/games/life-is-strange-remastered-collection/) and the Anime I love the most is [Komi can't Communicate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komi_Can%27t_Communicate) <3

â™¥ I do [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) ðŸ’œ, [Java](https://www.oracle.com/de/java/) â˜• and learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) ðŸ¦€ currently. I also do a little HTML CSS Website stuff but I don't like [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) ðŸŸ¨ :P
