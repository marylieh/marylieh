### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm [**Marie**](https://marylieh.social), a Systemadministrator and full-stack developer from Germany.

I'm primarily interested in **DevOps** and currently work as a **systemadministrator**.

I'm fascinated by container orchestration systems like kubernetes as well as cloud based infrastructure. I have programmed Minecraft plugins in Kotlin and love to develop discord bots in Kotlin as well. For business inquiries you can [email me](mailto:support@marylieh.social)
Currently I'm learning something about deep learning and Artificial Intelligence.

Outside of work, I'm interested in following the development of science, especially in space. I play video games and like to watch anime.
